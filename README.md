# DuckHunter

DuckHunter is a powerful tool designed to identify subdomain takeover vulnerabilities. It resolves DNS for given subdomains, checks for common patterns indicative of a potential takeover, and generates a comprehensive report. The tool supports both single-domain and multi-domain (from a list) checks, with color-coded output for easy interpretation.

## Features

- **Version Information**: Displays the current version and attribution at the start.
- **DNS Resolution**: Resolves DNS for each subdomain and checks for A records.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies vulnerable subdomains based on known patterns.
- **Color-Coded Output**:
  - **Red** for DNS resolution failures (`[Not Reachable]`).
  - **Green** for vulnerable subdomains (`[Vulnerable]`).
  - **Orange** for subdomains that are not vulnerable (`[Not Vulnerable]`).
- **Custom Help Message**: Displays "Usage of Duckhunter:" instead of the default Go usage message.

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/Acorzo1983/DuckHunter.git
cd DuckHunter
\`\`\`

## Usage

You can run DuckHunter with various options:

### Help

To display the help message:

\`\`\`bash
go run duckhunter.go -h
\`\`\`

### Checking a List of Subdomains

To check a list of subdomains provided in a file:

\`\`\`bash
go run duckhunter.go -l subdomains.txt -o report.txt
\`\`\`

### Checking a Single Domain

To check a single domain:

\`\`\`bash
go run duckhunter.go -d example.com -o report.txt
\`\`\`

### Example: Using DuckHunter with Subfinder

Subfinder is a subdomain discovery tool that can be used to generate a list of subdomains. Hereâ€™s how you can use Subfinder with DuckHunter:

1. **Install Subfinder** (if you haven't already):

    \`\`\`bash
    go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest
    \`\`\`

2. **Find Subdomains** for a given domain (e.g., `example.com`):

    \`\`\`bash
    subfinder -d example.com -o subdomains.txt
    \`\`\`

3. **Run DuckHunter** to check for vulnerabilities:

    \`\`\`bash
    go run duckhunter.go -l subdomains.txt -o report.txt
    \`\`\`

## Output

The results are color-coded in the terminal and saved to the specified output file:

- **[Not Reachable]**: Subdomains that could not be resolved.
- **[Vulnerable]**: Subdomains that are identified as vulnerable.
- **[Not Vulnerable]**: Subdomains that are not vulnerable.

## Example

\`\`\`bash
go run duckhunter.go -l subdomains.txt -o report.txt
\`\`\`

This command will read the subdomains from \`subdomains.txt\`, check for vulnerabilities, and save the report to \`report.txt\`.
